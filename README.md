# joshs-monster-tracker
* **Who?** My friend Josh.
* **What?** Tracking and nosying at his Monster/energy drink intake.
* **Why?** Some of us in the group have been hoping that he would tone it down a bit, for his own benefit; but mostly because its funny.
* **When?** We've been tracking since approx. May 2023, but we have a full dataset for the year 2024 so we shall be focusing on that.
* **Where?** I considered setting up a dedicated tool or submission point for him to use for this, but for the phone that he was using previously this would have been unfeasible, so instead I set him up his own lil channel in our group's server and let him go ham. \#joshs-monster-tracker 
* **How?** To be discussed:

## Stage 1 - Gathering the data
As above, decided that we were just gonna stick to discord because it was simple. We basically agreed that we somehow needed to gather the date/time of the drink (as opened), and what it was. A typical message would look like this:

![example message](<readme_content/image of message.png>)

We can take the date/time from the discord message metadata, although sometimes he did specify a different date/time when he couldn't record it initially. We also have the drink, a Monster Monarch.
